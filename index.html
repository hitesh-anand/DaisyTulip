			Hieeeeee girlfriend !<br />
			Do you remember our first meetup?<br />
			<span class="comments">// 3 days to go for its 5-monthaversary </span><br />
			That day I realized something <br />
			I realized that I love to be around you. Like fr. <br/>
			Talking to you, walking with you, listening to you. Literally anything. <br/>
			I wrote my first hand written letter to you that day. <br />
			I mentioned that somewhere inside my heart, I want this to be seroius.<br />
			US to be serious. <br />
			And here we are. <br />
			For the first time in my life, I found someone who was just like me. <br />
			Unhinged online, but equally anti-social in person. <br/>
			And then over time, our bond grew much stronger - both online and in person. <br/>
			I am so thankful for making my boring and monotonous life so colourful. <br/>
			If I had just 10 minutes to live, I would ask god for a walk with you from that cafe <br/>
			to Patna High court just like that day while holding my arm. <br/>
			If I had just 5 minutes to live, I would ask god to let me look at your face while <br/>
			you are sleeping so peacefully beside me <br/>
			If I had just 2 minutes to live, I would ask god to let me propose you again on my knees <br/>
			after giving you that pendant so that I could relive those 2 minutes and your reaction <br/>
			If I had just 30 seconds to live, I would ask god to let me give you my first letter again <br/>
			when I dropped you in the auto on our first meetup <br/>
			and then looked at you again and again while I was going back <br/>
			If I had just 10 seconds to live, I would ask god to let me be inside the Brewbakes lift<br/>
			when you grabbed my face and then we kissed for the first time <br/>
			Because you make my every moment so lively and colorful, and worth living <br/>
			<span class="comments">// And I'm sure there will be more.</span><br />
			You make me wanna improve and be a better person. <br/>
			I am sorry if I hurt you or if you feel I don't care about you <br/>
			But, trust me you are the best thing that happened to me <br/>
			And I am never gonna let you go. I will improve myself for you <br/>
			<br>
			<br>
			Because <br/>
			I LOVE YOU SO MUCH <br />
			and I WANNA BE YOURS <br/>
			<br>
			<br>
			Now If you want to hug me you can touch the heart below<br />
